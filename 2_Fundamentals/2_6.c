/*
Exercise 2.6: 
    Modify the program of Programming Project 5 so that the polynomial is evaluated using the
     following formula:

            ((((3x + 2)x â€“ 5)x  -1)x + 7)x  -6

    Note that the modified program performs fewer multiplications. 
    this technique for evaluating polynomials is known as Horner's Rule.
